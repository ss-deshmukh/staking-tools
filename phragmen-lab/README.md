# phragmen-lab

A local, offline playground for the Polkadot **multi-block election** (EPMB). It dumps a
live election round from the chain, then replays it through the **real**
`sp-npos-elections` solver — the same crate the runtime and the staking-miner use — so you
can ask _what-if_ questions about the score gate ("would electing fewer validators make
this solution pass?", "what if `minimumScore` were lower?") in seconds, without touching a
node.

The repo has two halves:

| dir     | language   | what it does                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ts/`   | TypeScript | `dump-snapshot.ts` — pulls a round's election snapshot off-chain into a JSON. |
| `rust/` | Rust       | the harness — runs seq-phragmén + balancing + scoring over that JSON.        |

You dump once (needs a live round on chain), then iterate on the Rust side as much as you
like, fully offline.

---

## Why this exists

On Asset Hub, staking elections run over many blocks (EPMB). A signed solution is
**rejected** if its `ElectionScore` is not `strict_better` than the on-chain
`minimumScore`. When that happens there's nothing useful left on chain (the verifier never
stores per-validator backings for a solution that fails the score gate), so you can't just
read the answer back.

Instead this tool reconstructs the election from its **input** — the voter and target
snapshots the round actually ran over — and re-derives the score locally. From there the
inputs (`desiredTargets`, `minimumScore`, balancing config) become plain knobs you can
change and re-run.

---

## How scoring / rejection works

`ElectionScore` has three fields (all in planck):

| field               | meaning                                                        | better is |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `minimal_stake`     | backing of the **weakest** elected validator                  | higher    |
| `sum_stake`         | total stake distributed across winners (≈ total active stake) | higher    |
| `sum_stake_squared` | Σ(backing²) — measures evenness of the distribution           | lower     |

The gate is `score.strict_better(minimumScore)`, which is **lexicographic** in order of
significance: `minimal_stake` ↑, then `sum_stake` ↑, then `sum_stake_squared` ↓.

In practice an exact tie on `minimal_stake` never happens, so the gate reduces to:

> **`minimal_stake > minimumScore.minimal_stake`**

i.e. the whole pass/fail decision is usually driven by the weakest winner's backing.
(Source: `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` verifier `ensure_score_quality` →
`FeasibilityError::ScoreTooLow`.)

This tool prints all three components but decides pass/fail with the real lexicographic
rule.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node + Yarn** (for the dumper). Any recent LTS Node works.
- **Rust toolchain** (`cargo`, `rustc`) — any recent stable.

```bash
yarn install     # one time, for the dumper deps
```

---

## Step 1 — dump a snapshot

The dumper must be run while the election round you care about is **live** on chain (the
snapshot only exists during the Snapshot/Signed/SignedValidation phases of a round — it's
cleared afterwards).

```bash
yarn dump \
  -e wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io \
  -b 17631723 \
  -o snapshot-238.json
```

Flags:

| flag           | meaning                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-e`           | Asset Hub wss endpoint (default: Polkadot Asset Hub)               |
| `-b`           | block number or hash to read at (default: latest finalized)        |
| `-r`           | election round override (default: `multiBlockElection.round` there)|
| `-o`           | output JSON path (default: `snapshot.json`)                        |

> ⚠️ **Staking lives on Asset Hub, not the relay chain.** Point `-e` at an Asset Hub RPC
> (`wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io`, `wss://kusama-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io`,
> `wss://westend-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io`). The relay chain no longer has the
> `multiBlockElection` pallet.

The output (~13 MB for Polkadot) contains the candidate list, every voter as
`(account, stake, [targets])`, plus the on-chain `desiredTargets` and `minimumScore`. It's
fully self-contained — no node needed after this. Snapshot files are git-ignored; commit
one only if you want to preserve a specific round.

---

## Step 2 — build the harness

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
```

The first build pulls the substrate crates and takes a minute or two; afterwards it's
instant.

---

## Step 3 — run

```bash
# from rust/ — score the round at its on-chain desiredTargets and check the gate
./target/release/phragmen-lab --snapshot ../snapshot-238.json
```

---

## Usage / flags (harness)

```
--snapshot <PATH>          (required) snapshot JSON from `yarn dump`
--desired-targets <N>      elect N validators (default: snapshot's on-chain desiredTargets)
--min-score-stake <TOKENS> override the minimal_stake floor, in WHOLE tokens (e.g. 700000)
--iterations <N>           balancing iterations (default 10, matches runtime)
--tolerance <N>            balancing tolerance (default 0, matches runtime)
--sweep <FROM> <TO>        sweep desired-targets from FROM down to TO (step 10), tabular output
```

### Examples

Score a specific target count:

```bash
./target/release/phragmen-lab --snapshot ../snapshot-238.json --desired-targets 550
```

Sweep a range to find where the solution starts passing:

```bash
./target/release/phragmen-lab --snapshot ../snapshot-238.json --sweep 600 500
```

Test a hypothetical lower `minimumScore` floor (e.g. would governance lowering it help?):

```bash
./target/release/phragmen-lab --snapshot ../snapshot-238.json --min-score-stake 650000
```

Match a different balancing depth:

```bash
./target/release/phragmen-lab --snapshot ../snapshot-238.json --iterations 20
```

---

## Reading the output

Single run shows the computed score, a per-component comparison against the threshold, and
the final lexicographic verdict:

```
=== Result (desired_targets = 550) ===
  minimal_stake     : 1,149,499.0770 DOT
  sum_stake         : 809,839,480.9661 DOT
  sum_stake_squared : 122186709403440325083244402324560389

  vs minimumScore (lexicographic strict_better):
    minimal_stake     >= (ok) 789,555.2765 DOT
    sum_stake         >= (ok) 565,583,855.1978 DOT
    sum_stake_squared <  (ok) 187148285683372481445131595645808873 (lower is better)

  FULL SCORE: PASS ✅ (strict_better than minimumScore)
```

Sweep prints one row per target count with a `strict_better?` column — the cheapest way to
find the crossing point.

---

## Worked example: round 238

Round 238's signed solution was rejected. Running the lab on its snapshot:

| desired_targets | minimal_stake | full score passes? |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 600 (on-chain)  | 675,220 DOT   | ❌ no              |
| 590             | 765,382 DOT   | ❌ no              |
| 580             | 770,013 DOT   | ❌ no (just short) |
| **570**         | 893,348 DOT   | ✅ **yes**        |
| 550             | 1,149,499 DOT | ✅ yes (~46% over) |
| 500             | 1,320,000 DOT | ✅ yes            |

The floor is `789,555 DOT`. The rejection is entirely a `minimal_stake` problem — the
other two components pass at every target count. Electing fewer validators redistributes
stake onto the survivors, lifting the weakest winner's backing above the floor. The
crossing sits between 580 (fail) and 570 (pass); 550 clears it comfortably.

Notice `sum_stake` barely moves across the whole range (~811M → ~805M) while
`minimal_stake` nearly doubles — the fix is about _distribution_, not the size of the
staking pie.

## Fidelity / caveats

- The solver is `sp-npos-elections` 42.0.0 (deps pin `sp-arithmetic` 28.0.1) — the same
  crate family the runtime uses. The pipeline is
  `seq_phragmen` → `assignment_ratio_to_staked_normalized` → `to_supports` →
  `evaluate_support`, with `BalancingConfig { iterations: 10, tolerance: 0 }`. This mirrors
  the runtime miner (`election-provider-multi-block/src/unsigned/miner.rs`): EPMB flattens
  all voter pages and runs `seq_phragmen` **once** over every voter (it is *not* a per-page
  solve), exactly as the lab does. The accuracy type is `Perbill`, and the chain feeds raw
  planck as the `VoteWeight` (Polkadot/Westend use `SaturatingCurrencyToVote`, which does
  no scaling); the lab saturates that planck → `u64` the same way the chain does.

- **The score the lab computes is the chain's _pre-trim_ score** — an upper bound on the
  real `minimal_stake`. The runtime, after solving, applies several trimming passes before
  scoring: a global `MaxBackersPerWinner` truncation (`sorted_truncate_from`), a per-page
  backer trim, and a length/weight trim. Trimming drops the weakest backers and can
  therefore only **lower** a winner's backing — so the on-chain `minimal_stake` may come out
  somewhat below what the lab reports. The lab does **not** model trimming. For finding the
  `desired_targets` pass/fail crossing this is fine (it shifts the crossing
  conservatively), but don't read the absolute `minimal_stake` as bit-exact.

- Validated against round 238: the lab reproduces the on-chain `sum_stake` and
  `sum_stake_squared` closely; `minimal_stake` lands within ~1% (balancing is
  iteration-sensitive, and the chain's trimming further lowers it). Conclusions about
  pass/fail crossings are robust to that wobble.

- The gate the lab checks is `score.strict_better(minimumScore)`. On chain a solution must
  *also* be `strict_better` than any already-**queued** solution (`ensure_score_quality`
  checks both); the lab only models the `minimumScore` floor, since that's the governance
  knob you tweak in what-ifs.

- `reduce()` is deliberately omitted: it is support-preserving, so it does not change the
  score. (The chain calls it for solution size, not score.)

- If you need bit-exact reproduction of a particular submission, match the
  `--iterations`/`--tolerance` to the config the miner used for that solution.

- The candidate identifier used internally is the candidate's **index** in the snapshot
  (not the SS58 string), purely for solver speed. The snapshot keeps the SS58 list if you
  need to map indices back to accounts.
